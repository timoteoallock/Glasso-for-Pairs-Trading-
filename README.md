# Glasso-for-Pairs-Trading-

In this paper we investigate the use of Graphical LASSO (GLASSO) for pairs trading, a
trading strategy based on statistical arbitrage that aims to explore mean-reversion patterns between pairs of financial securities. We implement the strategy in R and propose a model selection method that, to our knowledge,
has never been adopted in this context. The research question is whether a GLASSO-based
pairs trading strategy can outperform strategies that select pairs randomly.
